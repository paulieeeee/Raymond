	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of 
	<i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and all other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was in a well thumbed copy of <cite>On The Road</cite>.
	It had been Molly favourite book since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls she felt she needed to be free.</p>
	<p style="font-family:cascadia code extralight;"
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an
	Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who
	having nothing to do</q>. Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling screte of llama
	<abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to ber an outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think she had
	something better to do.</p>
